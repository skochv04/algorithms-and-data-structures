# Alice wants to give a party and wonders who to invite from among the n friends. She has already
# created a list of pairs of people who know each other. She wants to select as many people as possible,
# so that at the party, each pearson should know at least x people and at least x people not to know.
# Write an algorithm that takes a list of n people and a list of pairs of people who know each other.
# Find the longest possible list of guests.
