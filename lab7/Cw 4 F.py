# Algocia is placed on a great dessert and consists of cities and oases connected by roads. There is
# exactly one road leading from each gate to one oasis (but any given oasis can have any number of roads
# leading to them, oases can also be interconnected by roads). Algocian law requires that if someone
# enters a city through one gate, they must leave the other. Check of Algocia decided to send a bishop
# who will read the prohibition of formulating tasks "about the chessboard" (insult majesty) task in
# every city. Check wants the bishop to visit each city exactly once (but there is no limit how many
# times the bishop will visit each oasis). Bishop departs from the capital of Algocia city x, and after
# visiting all cities the bishop has to come back to city x. Find algorithm that determines if there
# is a suitable route for bishop.
