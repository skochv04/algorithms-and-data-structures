# We are given n points (x, y) that are in circle with radius k (natural number)
# i.e. 0 <= x^2 + y^2 <= k which are evenly distributed in it (The probability of finding a point
# in a given area is proportional to the area of this whole area). Find algorithm that in time
# O(n) will sort the points by their distance to the point (0, 0) i.e. d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).
